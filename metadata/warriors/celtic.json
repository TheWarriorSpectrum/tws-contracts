  "name": "Celtic Warrior",
  "description": "The warriors of Celtic Europe were amongst the most distinctive of any fighters in the ancient world. With their great height, long hair and moustaches, frequent nakedness, painted and tattooed bodies, and fondness for collecting enemy heads in battle, Celtic warriors were a fearsome sight to behold. Fighting on foot, horseback, or in a chariot, Celtic warriors are also notable for the inclusion of women in their ranks and sometimes as their leaders. Long-overshadowed by their ultimate victors the Romans and others, Celtic warriors such as Brennus (c. 390 CE), Vercingetorix (82-46 BCE), Ambiorix (c. 54/53 BCE), and Queen Boudicca (d. 61 CE) certainly caused their enemies trouble and impressed them with their determination and valour in battle.",
