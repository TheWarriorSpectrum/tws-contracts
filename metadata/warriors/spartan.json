  "description": "The Spartan army stood at the center of the Spartan state, citizens trained in the disciplines and honor of a warrior society. Subjected to military drills since early manhood, the Spartans became one of the most feared and formidable military forces in the Greek world, attaining legendary status in their wars against Persia. At the height of Sparta's power – between the 6th and 4th centuries BC – other Greeks commonly accepted that \"one Spartan was worth several men of any other state.\n\nTradition states that the semi-mythical Spartan legislator Lycurgus first founded the iconic army.[2] Referring to Sparta as having a \"wall of men, instead of bricks,\" he proposed reforming the Spartan society to develop a military-focused lifestyle following \"proper virtues\" such as equality for the male citizens, austerity, strength, and fitness. A Spartan male's involvement with the army began in infancy when the Gerousia first inspected him. Any baby judged weak or deformed was left at Mount Taygetus to die since the Spartan society was no place for those who could not fend for themselves. (The practice of discarding children at birth took place in Athens as well.) Those deemed strong enough entered the agoge regime at the age of seven, which would require the young boys or Spartiates to undergo intense and rigorous military training.",
