# The Warrior Spectrum: A non-crypto-native NFT auto battle card game powered by Chainlink and Polygon. 

# Description 

It is a “path choosing NFT“ Game where collectors hunt, collect, and win specific NFTs in order to level up their character. There are 7 levels and 3 primary categories of NFTs. Warriors. Elementals. Companions. 

As collectors level up they get to “choose the path” their warrior takes by collecting  elementals and companions to evolve them with their main character to level up. 

The aims of the game is to reach the ultimate prize which is a Level 6 warrior (only 35 have been minted) and to build a good and supportive community around the project.
